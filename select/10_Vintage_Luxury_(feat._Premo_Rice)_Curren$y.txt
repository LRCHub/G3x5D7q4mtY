Uh

Baby girl, who you lookin' for?
Will let you through my door
Flowers set on fire, animal hides is on the floor
This life is raw, you might be blinded by some shit I saw
When I started, all I wanted was a car
You know what happened with your dog, oh, yeah, I've come quite far
Them other fools is all soon to fall off
Flow is subpar, and people noticin', even the broads
Can't pull a war, over the eyes of the guy
Old school, Coolie High
What I'm wearin', what I drive
Every tale in 1995
Vintage luxury, draw her hand, she had to fuck with me
Prove her lovе for me, stacks 'em up for me
Provе her love for me, stacks 'em up for me
Vintage luxury, draw her hand, she had to fuck with me
Prove her love for me, stacks 'em up for me
My dog Premo Rice flew in today
I did
Told 'em in two days, you know
Man of my word

She knew to come correct when she stepped to me
'Cause time is a jewel
She felt the leather then she turned to a pool
I gave her game up in that fat fifth
Probably bumpin' some from nine-six
And always mac chickens with wide hips
It's easy for me
She's tryin' hard, she gettin' Geechee for me
Get outta line, I'm like easy shawty
Don't get to actin' stupid ho, you get erased
I got a bunch of bad bitches in the safe
And believe they want a taste
Of the motherfuckin' man, nigga

'Cause baby girl, you ain't that fine
My life subpar
Bitch, don't even look at my car
I see from afar
You ain't that fine

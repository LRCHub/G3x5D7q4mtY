When you're living in the lap of luxury
The world gives you exactly what you need
I'm not talking 'bout material shit
I'm speaking more in a spiritual sense
You see, life is intense, people living in tents
Happiness within and you get what you give
Wake up in the morning, thank god for my health
Laugh like Ray Charles then I hug myself
In the lap of luxury, living in the lap of luxury
If you feel what I'm saying, then trust, my G
You could be living in the lap of luxury
In the lap of luxury, living in the lap of luxury
You don't need a hundred million bucks to be
Living in the lap of luxury

Going with the flow, and I'm the captain of the ship
Barricades in my path don't actually exist
The waves may shift to make me seasick
And maybe I can't swim, but I definitely can't quit
Trying to maintain the zen
Problems that arise, find ways to fix
Don't always hit my target, but I aim to win
So many things to be thankful, it's
My goal to try and control how much I complain 'bout shit
But let me explain the language
When you're living in the lap of luxury
It's up to you, it's up to me
To tango, it takes two, one must agree
If really for yourself what you want is peace
Peace, peace, peace
Do it for yourself no matter what who gon' hate
I do it in my own strange, unusual ways
I do it for the fam, I do it for Umi Rae
Do it for those wanna see me truly be great
Do it for the higher power that extending my stay
And watched over every moment ever since a young age

When you're living in the lap of luxury
The world gives you exactly what you need
I'm not talking 'bout material shit
I'm speaking more in a spiritual sense
You see, life is intense, people living in tents
Happiness within and you get what you give
Wake up in the morning, thank god for my health
Laugh like Ray Charles then I hug myself
In the lap of luxury, living in the lap of luxury
If you feel what I'm saying, then trust, my G
You could be living in the lap of luxury
In the lap of luxury, living in the lap of luxury
You don't need a hundred million bucks to be
Living in the lap of luxury
